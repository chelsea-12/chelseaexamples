### [DEF CON 31 What can we learn about hacking in SciFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psBN9wTZhXk)


- Nicolas Minvielle & Xavier Facelina
- science fiction drives reality
- there is a feedback loop between science fiction that drives the innovation and the innovation that inspires science fiction
- science fiction raises the publics' awareness of politics: this is done by showing either utopia (something that we want) or dystopia (something we don't want)
- to make the relation to hacking they looked further into what is the representation of the word 'hacker'
- there is a strong archetype for this word: shady figures, masks, hoody etc.
- it's a very caricatural representation and this is what the general public thinks and therefore there is a lack of awareness
- however the speak said there is a feedback interaction with this caricature, and that often when he dresses as that stereotype then he feels more part of the hacker community
- part of their research was to watch/read over 200 different SciFi movies/TV shows/books/comics etc.
- they then analysed the type of hacking shown in each of these: around 25% was spying, 25% was attacking things and the majority was about influencing people. The government is the main target in these, followed by the military and then civilians.
- they followed this up with studying over 1000 real life hacking attacks to compare: over 80% was spying government data, and very little of it was attacking or destroying things in direct contrast to what is mainly seen in SciFi
- however over the past 10 years there has been an increase in attacks (pipeline explosions etc.) so the speaker believes this is mirroring what is mainly seen in SciFi
- so can we look at SciFi to figure out how to protect ourselves from these types of attacks
