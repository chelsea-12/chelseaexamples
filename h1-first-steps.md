## Installing Debian12

I have previously used VirtualBox to install Ubuntu before, so this task was fairly straightforward for me. It was good we went over it in class however, as my VirtualBox kept defaulting to 32-bit Debian and luckily I knew to check it was set to 64-bit.
The download and installation process went fairly quickly and there were no errors along the way. 
I tried to take some screenshots throughout the process and quickly realised I needed to click outside of the VirtualBox screen onto my Windows desktop in order to save the print screen onto my Windows, otherwise it tries to printscreen within the Linux.

## Podacast Summary


## Article Summary

- An interesting article summing up the need to have intelligent responses to hackers in order to stay one step ahead of them by having effected defences.
- It introduces the concept of a kill chain - a military term used for targeting and engaging adversaries, and how it has been adapted to cyber security terminology with regards to digital intrusion.
- Briefly summed up, the intrusion kill chain involves indentifying targets (eg. through e-mail lists), weaponising some type of tool (something like a PDF file), delivering said tool and then exploiting the victims systems so the intruder can then go onto controlling the victims network and thus achieving their goals.
- It is important that all steps must be followed in order for the final objective to be successful.
- With these steps known, cyber security specialists can try to mount a defence against any intruders. Different steps require different tactics, and the tactics need to continuously evolve to keep up with intruders.
- The article specifically mentions that solely focusing on 'zero day attacks' is short-sighted if you are not effectively protecting from the other steps of the intrusion kill chain.
- My feeling after reading this article is that we must remain vigilant in the face of network intruders, and continually evolve along with potential hackers as they will continue to try and find ways to exploit any vunerabilities.
