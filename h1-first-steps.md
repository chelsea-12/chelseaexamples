## Installing Debian12

I have previously used VirtualBox to install Ubuntu before, so this task was fairly straightforward for me. It was good we went over it in class however, as my VirtualBox kept defaulting to 32-bit Debian and luckily I knew to check it was set to 64-bit.
The download and installation process went fairly quickly and there were no errors along the way. 
I tried to take some screenshots throughout the process and quickly realised I needed to click outside of the VirtualBox screen onto my Windows desktop in order to save the print screen onto my Windows, otherwise it tries to printscreen within the Linux.

## Podcast Summary

Darknet Diaries Episode 95: Jon & Brian's Big Adventure
This episode interviewed two penetration testers working at a place called RedTeam Security - they get paid to hack into buildings and networks in order to test their systems. The episode covered how they prepare and carry out these types of missions, and what can go wrong.

- This seems like a very versatile job. Need to have a wide skill set in order to bypass both physical and virtual barriers. This is not just breaking into a digital environment, this is opening locked doors and evading security cameras.
- Lots of mentioning 'raspberry pi', so I needed to look this up on Google as I've never heard the term before: It's a small, cheap computer than runs Linux. They can be hidden easily.

- When carrying out a job, these guys keep in constant contact with the companies they are trying to break into so they can try and avoid getting into unfortunate situations (only one point of contact - the security teams and employees do not know they are going to break in. Police are also notified ahead of time).
- Some interesting techiques for them to try and break into buildings. A surprising one is that they look through company and employee social medias and websites to try and look at photos that may give away any important details (is there a dresscode in the office so they can fit in, can they see security cameras in pictures etc.). A surprising amount of detail can be gleamed from social media.
- Even when they get caught on one of these jobs, they can still get a lot of useful information (how well the security cameras work, or how vigilant staff are)

## Article Summary

- An interesting article summing up the need to have intelligent responses to hackers in order to stay one step ahead of them by having effected defences.
- It introduces the concept of a kill chain - a military term used for targeting and engaging adversaries, and how it has been adapted to cyber security terminology with regards to digital intrusion.
- Briefly summed up, the intrusion kill chain involves indentifying targets (eg. through e-mail lists), weaponising some type of tool (something like a PDF file), delivering said tool and then exploiting the victims systems so the intruder can then go onto controlling the victims network and thus achieving their goals.
- It is important that all steps must be followed in order for the final objective to be successful.
- With these steps known, cyber security specialists can try to mount a defence against any intruders. Different steps require different tactics, and the tactics need to continuously evolve to keep up with intruders.
- The article specifically mentions that solely focusing on 'zero day attacks' is short-sighted if you are not effectively protecting from the other steps of the intrusion kill chain.
- My feeling after reading this article is that we must remain vigilant in the face of network intruders, and continually evolve along with potential hackers as they will continue to try and find ways to exploit any vunerabilities.
