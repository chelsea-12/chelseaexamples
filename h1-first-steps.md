## Installing Debian12

I have previously used VirtualBox to install Ubuntu before, so this task was fairly straightforward for me. It was good we went over it in class however, as my VirtualBox kept defaulting to 32-bit Debian and luckily I knew to check it was set to 64-bit.
The download and installation process went fairly quickly and there were no errors along the way. 
I tried to take some screenshots throughout the process and quickly realised I needed to click outside of the VirtualBox screen onto my Windows desktop in order to save the print screen onto my Windows, otherwise it tries to printscreen within the Linux.
