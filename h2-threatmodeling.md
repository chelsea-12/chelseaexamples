### Threat modeling manifesto [(link)](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org)

- Four key questions of threat modeling: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job?
- Threat modeling can help prevent issues before they have even occurred. If you threat model ahead of time, you can factor this into the planning of your system
- Threat modeling is for everyone, regardless of what system you are implementing. This is not something reserved just for tech professionals
- Relative values in threat modeling are important, such as: valuing continuous refinement over doing something once, and valuing a culture of finding and fixing problems rather than just complying with check box standards
- Patterns than benefit threat modeling include, but are not limited to: a wide variety of view points to better inform the situation, approaching the situation systematically, and allowing for creativity.
- Patterns that may hinder threat modeling can include: the belief that you must hold a certain skill set in order to threat model and over-focusing on a certain issue rather than looking at the bigger picture
