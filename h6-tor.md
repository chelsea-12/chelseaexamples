# H6 Tor


## Summaries


### [7 things you should know about Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)


- Tor has most likely not been broken on a cryptographic level, but possible attacks can come from browser bugs, user misconfiguration and traffic correlation attacks
- Tor is not just for criminals; e.g. activists use it to circumvent restrictions
- Initial development of Tor was funded by the US navy, but there is no military 'back door'
- No one in the United States has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay
- Tor is very easy to install and use
- Tor does run slower than the normal internet but improvements are always being made
- Tor is still not 100% safe and caution does need to be taken with it's usage (e.g. keeping it up-to-date, using browser bundle or tails)


### [The Tor Browser](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0010)


- Tor (otherwise known as The Onion Router) was developed by modifying Firefox, and works by hiding the true IP of the users, making them difficult to track
- a lot of it's success comes from how easy it is to use
- can be used for a lot of legitimate purposes, but also for criminal activities
- originally developed by the US government, but not currently controlled by them; it is open for anyone to improve upon if they can
- Tor directs the route of a userâ€™s Internet traffic through random relays on the Internet
- data is layered with elliptic curve cryptography which is currently unbreakable with brute force
- data is sent through three layers; after the first 2 relays a layer of encryption is shed each time and then finally in the 3rd relay there is an unencrypted connection with the host target
- every 10 minutes a new random route to the target is chosen
- breaking Tor has not happened, but exploiting user errors have led to arrests
- the best thing a Tor user can do is to not customise the browser


## Installing Tor


I installed Tor during class time. It was a very easy and quick process, and I was actually surprised by how few steps there were. I used [this](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/) website to help me.


First, I downloaded Tor for Linux from [here](https://www.torproject.org/download/) ![image](https://github.com/chelsea-12/chelseaexamples/assets/144318656/b7e963e2-c8df-4449-936e-ea04326b9773)

I extracted the file. I did not need to change permissions on it, and simply double clicked on the icon and Tor started working.
