## WebGoat 2023.4

I managed to install WebGoat during class time and everything went well, apart from needing to take one additional step during the process. Before downloading the WebGoat JAR using the wget command, I needed to first install wget. This was done through this simple command: 
> $ sudo apt-get install wget

I also solved the Developer Tools during class time. This actually took more time than it should have due to my Linux screen being impossibly small. This was solved by installing guest additions to VirtualBox; a classmate helped me to do this (thanks, Pan!) but if you run into this issue, hopefully [this](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/) helps (scroll down to find the relevant section)!

Once this small, but very large, issue was solved I was able to move on.

This was relatively easy to solve with the provided information from the Portswigger website however, understanding *why* this was the solution took quite a bit longer.
